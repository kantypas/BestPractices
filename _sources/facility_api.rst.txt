NERSC
~~~~~
NERSC is developing the `SuperFacility API <https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/sfapi/>`_
that can be used to script jobs or workflows running against NERSC systems.
The goal is to support everything from a simple script that submits a job to complex
workflows that move files, check job progress and make advance compute time reservations.
